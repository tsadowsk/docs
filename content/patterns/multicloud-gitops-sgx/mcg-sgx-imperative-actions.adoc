== Using kubernetes cronjobs to apply imperative actions

There is currently no way within Argo CD to apply an imperative action against a cluster. However, you can declaratively apply changes to a cluster using kubernetes cronjob resources. Customers can use their Ansible playbooks to take action against a cluster if necessary.

[WARNING]
====
The authors of the Ansible playbooks and roles must ensure that the playbooks are idempotent because they get applied through cronjobs which are set to run every 10 minutes.
====

Adding your playbooks to the pattern requires the following:

. Move your Ansible configurations to the appropriate directory under Ansible in your forked repository.
. Define your job as a list, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
  imperative:
    # NOTE: We *must* use lists and not hashes. As hashes lose ordering once parsed by helm
    # The default schedule is every 10 minutes: imperative.schedule
    # Total timeout of all jobs is 1h: imperative.activeDeadlineSeconds
    # imagePullPolicy is set to always: imperative.imagePullPolicy
    # For additional overrides that apply to the jobs, please refer to the README located in
    # the top level of this repository.
    jobs:
    - name: regional-ca
      # Ansible playbook to be run
      playbook: ansible/playbooks/on-hub-get-regional-ca.yml
      # per playbook timeout in seconds
      timeout: 234
      # verbosity: "-v"
----

== Additional job customizations

The pattern includes override parameters to provide further customization. Refer to the list below for the available overrides.

[source,yaml]
----
  imperative:
    jobs: []
    # This image contains Ansible + kubernetes.core by default and is used to run the jobs
    image: registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-22/ee-supported-rhel8:latest
    namespace: "imperative"
    # configmap name in the namespace that will contain all helm values
    valuesConfigMap: "helm-values-configmap"
    cronJobName: "imperative-cronjob"
    jobName: "imperative-job"
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    # This is the maximum timeout of all the jobs (1h)
    activeDeadlineSeconds: 3600
    # By default we run this every 10minutes
    schedule: "*/10 * * * *"
    # Schedule used to trigger the vault unsealing (if explicitely enabled)
    # Set to run every 9 minutes in order for load-secrets to succeed within
    # a reasonable amount of time (it waits up to 15 mins)
    insecureUnsealVaultInsideClusterSchedule: "*/9 * * * *"
    # Increase Ansible verbosity with '-v' or '-vv..'
    verbosity: ""
    serviceAccountCreate: true
    # service account to be used to run the cron pods
    serviceAccountName: imperative-sa
    clusterRoleName: imperative-cluster-role
    clusterRoleYaml: ""
    roleName: imperative-role
    roleYaml: ""
