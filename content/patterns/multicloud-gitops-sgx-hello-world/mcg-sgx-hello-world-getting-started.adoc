== Deploying the {mcg-sgx-hello-world-pattern}

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console] and select *Services \-> Containers \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`.
 ** link:../../multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world/mcg-sgx-hello-world-cluster-sizing[Cluster sizing] requirements.
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
* {intel-sgx} enabled in BIOS (Basic Input Output System) on at least one worker machines - specific steps depends on platform.
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].
* Machine with the Ubuntu 22.04 (for image conversion purposes - doesn't need to have SGX feature enabled) and git.
 ** Gramine Shielded Containers (GSC) application requires a machine with the same OS as an input image which will be conversed.
 ** Install the https://gramine.readthedocs.io/projects/gsc/en/latest/#prerequisites[GSC prerequisites].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].
+
. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/sgx-multicloud-gitops-hello-world/[multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world] repository on GitHub.
. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone git@github.com:your-username/multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world.git
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials for the `config-demo` application and edit it if you want to customize the secret. If not, the framework generates a random password.
+
[source,terminal]
----
cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
====

. (Optional) You may customize the deployment for your cluster depending on your needs by editing _values-global.yaml_ and _values-hub.yaml_. To do this run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
git checkout -b my-branch
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
vi values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git add values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git commit values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git push origin my-branch
----

. Prepare and build `hello-world` docker image and convert it to secure version using GSC - described below.

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator] - both methods are described below.

[id="build-docker-image-and-convert-to-sgx"]
== Prepare docker image and convert it to use Intel SGX

To build docker image and convert it to secure version with SGX, complete the following steps using machine dedicated for GSC conversion:

. Create an empty file named _Dockerfile_:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ touch Dockerfile
----
+
. Using a text editor, copy the following contents to the _Dockerfile_:
+
[source,dockerfile]
----
FROM python:3.12
RUN apt update
RUN rm /usr/bin/X11
ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "-c", "print('HelloWorld!')"]
----
+
. Build the docker image using the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker build -t hello-world .
----
+
. Clone GSC repo:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/gramineproject/gsc.git
----
. Copy configuration file from sample template:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cd gsc
$ cp config.yaml.template config.yaml
----
(Optional) This file can be adjusted if needed.

. Create new file _hello-world.manifest_ containing parameters of conversion:
+
[source,file]
----
loader.pal_internal_mem_size = "1G" 
sgx.enclave_size = "1G" 
sgx.thread_num = 1024 
----
. Generate the signing key:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ openssl genrsa -3 -out enclave-key.pem 3072
----
+
. Build secure image using `gsc` command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./gsc build hello-world hello-world.manifest
----
. Sign the graminized docker image:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ ./gsc sign-image hello-world enclave-key.pem
----
. Push secured container image to registry which is available on the cluster:  
.. Tag secured container image with appropriate tag and push the image to a registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker tag gsc-hello-world <DOCKER_REPOSITORY>:<TAG>
----
`<DOCKER_REPOSITORY>` is name a docker repository, `<TAG>` is a version of an image

.. Login to Docker Hub:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker login -u=<DOCKER_ID> docker.io 
----
`<DOCKER_ID>` is your login to Docker Hub

.. Push the image to registry:  
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ docker push <DOCKER_REPOSITORY>:<TAG>
----
. Update the file _charts/all/hello-world-sgx/values.yaml_ with the information about your image in your forked repo with pattern.

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

To deploy the cluster by using the _pattern.sh_ file, complete the following steps:

. Login to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc login
----
+
Optional: Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable for the _kubeconfig_ file path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
./pattern.sh make install
----

Verify that the Operators have been installed.

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1): 
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes* 
* *Intel Device Plugins Operator* 
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes* 
* *Node Feature Discovery Operator* 
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*
* *Validated Patterns Operator*

+


== Deploying the cluster by using the Validated Patterns Operator

To install the *Validated Patterns Operator*:

. Log in to the *Openshift Container Platform* web console and select *Operators > OperatorHub*.

. Search for *Validated Patterns Operator*, open it and click *Install*.
+
.Install Validated Patterns Operator
image::multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world/sgx-validated-pattern-operator.png[Install Validated Patterns Operator,scale=50]
+
. Choose default settings for the installation mode, namespaces and update strategy and confirm it by clicking *Install*.

. Select *Operators > Installed Operators*.

. Ensure that *Validated Patterns Operator* is listed in the `openshift-operators` project with a status `Succeeded`.

After succeeded installation open *Validated Patterns Operator*, go to *Pattern* tab and click *Create Pattern*.

. Fill the *Name* of the pattern `multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world` and *Cluster Group Name* `hub` (from _values-global.yaml_ file).

. Under *Git Config > Target Repo* copy the link to your fork and under *Git Config > Target Revision* write the name of your branch (Figure 3).

. Click *Create* to create the pattern.
+
.Create Pattern Form
image::multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world/sgx-create-pattern.png[Create Pattern Form]
+


Verify that the rest of Operators have been installed:

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1): 
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes* 
* *Intel Device Plugins Operator* 
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes* 
* *Node Feature Discovery Operator* 
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*

Add a secret for `config-demo` application (from _values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml_) to *Vault* manually:

. Go to Vault service route. URL can be found:

.. by running command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc -n vault get route vault -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----
+
.. in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for `vault` project.

. Log into the Vault using root token. Root token can be found by executing command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc -n imperative get secrets vaultkeys -ojsonpath='{.data.vault_data_json}' | base64 -d
----
+

. After login go to `secret` catalog and clik *Create secret* and fill all the fields manually (Figure 2):

.. *Path for this secret* is `global/config-demo` (from _values.yaml_ file for `config-demo` charts)

.. Under *Secret data* key is `secret` (from _values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml_ file) and in next field put its value.

.. Click *Add* and then *Save*.
+
.Create secret

+


== Verification

Go to the Hub ArgoCD and verify that all applications are synchronized. The URL can be found in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for the project `multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world-hub` or use command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc -n multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world-hub get route hub-gitops-server -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

All applications should be `Healthy` and `Synced`:

.ArgoCD panel with `hello-world-sgx` app
image::multicloud-gitops-sgx-hello-world/multicloud-gitops-argocd-sgx.png[ArgoCD panel with hello-world-sgx app]
Check the logs of a pod `hello-world-sgx` to verify if it uses *{intel-sgx}*. In the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Workloads > Pods*. Change project to `hello-world-sgx` and open the *Logs* tab in the pod details. The Gramine output confirms that {intel-sgx} is used.

As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].
