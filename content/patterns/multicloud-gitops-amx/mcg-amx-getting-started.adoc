== Deploying the {amx-mcg-pattern}

.Prerequisites

* An OpenShift cluster
 ** To create an OpenShift cluster, go to the https://console.redhat.com/[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud console] and select *Services \-> Containers \-> Create cluster*.
 ** The cluster must have a dynamic `StorageClass` to provision `PersistentVolumes`.
 ** link:../../multicloud-gitops-amx/mcg-amx-cluster-sizing[Cluster sizing] requirements.
* Optional: A second OpenShift cluster for multicloud demonstration.
//Replaced git and podman prereqs with the tooling dependencies page
* https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].

The use of this pattern depends on having at least one running Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, consider creating a cluster for deploying the GitOps management hub assets and a separate cluster for the managed cluster.

If you do not have a running Red Hat OpenShift cluster, you can start one on a
public or private cloud by using https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console].

.Procedure

. https://validatedpatterns.io/learn/quickstart/[Install the tooling dependencies].
+
//[ii]remember to give proper links!!!
. Fork the https://github.com/validatedpatterns-sandbox/amx-accelerated-multicloud-gitops[multicloud-gitops-amx] repository on GitHub.
. Clone the forked copy of this repository.
+
[source,terminal]
----
git clone git@github.com:your-username/amx-accelerated-multicloud-gitops.git
----

. Create a local copy of the secret values file that can safely include credentials for the config-demo application and edit it if you want to customize the secret. If not, the framework generates a random password.
+
[source,terminal]
----
cp values-secret.yaml.template ~/values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not commit this file. You do not want to push personal credentials to GitHub.
====

. (Optional) You may customize the deployment for your cluster depending on your needs by editing values-global.yaml and values-hub.yaml. To do this run the following commands:
+
[source,terminal]
----
git checkout -b my-branch
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
vi values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git add values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git commit values-global.yaml
----
+
[source,terminal]
----
git push origin my-branch
----

. Deploy the pattern by running `./pattern.sh make install` or by using the link:/infrastructure/using-validated-pattern-operator/[Validated Patterns Operator] - both methods are described below.

[id="deploying-cluster-using-patternsh-file"]
== Deploying the cluster by using the pattern.sh file

To deploy the cluster by using the `pattern.sh` file, complete the following steps:

. Login to your cluster by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc login
----
+
Optional: Set the `KUBECONFIG` variable for the `kubeconfig` file path:
+
[source,terminal]
----
export KUBECONFIG=~/<path_to_kubeconfig>
----

. Deploy the pattern to your cluster. Run the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
./pattern.sh make install
----

Verify that the Operators have been installed.

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1):
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes*
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes*
* *Node Feature Discovery Operator*
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*
* *Validated Patterns Operator*

+


== Deploying the cluster by using the Validated Patterns Operator

To install the *Validated Patterns Operator*:

. Log in to the *Openshift Container Platform* web console and select *Operators > OperatorHub*.

. Search for *Validated Patterns Operator*, open it and click *Install*.
+
.Instal Validated Patterns Operator
image::multicloud-gitops-amx/amx-validated-patter-operator.png[Install Validated Patterns Operator,scale=50]
+
. Choose default settings for the installation mode, namespaces and update strategy and confirm it by clicking *Install*.

. Select *Operators > Installed Operators*.

. Ensure that *Validated Patterns Operator* is listed in the `openshift-operators` project with a status `Succeeded`.

After succeeded installation open *Validated Patterns Operator*, go to *Pattern* tab and click *Create Pattern*.

. Fill the *Name* of the pattern `multicloud-gitops-amx` and *Cluster Group Name* `hub` (from _values-global.yaml_ file).

. Under *Git Config > Target Repo* copy the link to your fork and under *Git Config > Target Revision* write the name of your branch (Figure 3).

. Click *Create* to create the pattern.
+
.Create Pattern Form
image::multicloud-gitops-amx/amx-create-pattern.png[Create pattern Multicloud GitOps with AMX]
+


Verify that the rest of Operators have been installed:

. To verify, in the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Operators → Installed Operators* page.
. Check that the following Operators are installed with  `Succeeded` status (Figure 1):
* *Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes*
* *multicluster engine for Kubernetes*
* *Node Feature Discovery Operator*
* *Red Hat Openshift GitOps*

Add a secret for `config-demo` application (from _values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml_) to *Vault* manually:

. Go to Vault service route. URL can be found:

.. by running command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc -n vault get route vault -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----
+
.. in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for `vault` project.

. Log into the Vault using root token. Root token can be found by executing command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
oc -n imperative get secrets vaultkeys -ojsonpath='{.data.vault_data_json}' | base64 -d
----
+

. After login go to `secret` catalog and clik *Create secret* and fill all the fields manually (Figure 2):

.. *Path for this secret* is `global/config-demo` (from _values.yaml_ file for `config-demo` charts)

.. Under *Secret data* key is `secret` (from _values-secret-multicloud-gitops.yaml_ file) and in next field put its value.

.. Click *Add* and then *Save*.
+
.Create secret

+


== Verification

Go to the Hub ArgoCD and verify that all applications are synchronized. The URL can be found in *Openshift Container Platform* web console under *Networking > Routes* for the project `multicloud-gitops-amx-hub` or use command:

[source,terminal]
----
oc -n multicloud-gitops-amx-hub get route hub-gitops-server -ojsonpath='{.spec.host}'
----

All applications should be `Healthy` and `Synced`:

.ArgoCD panel with `amx-app`
image::multicloud-gitops-amx/multicloud-gitops-argocd-amx.png[Multicloud GitOps Hub with `amx-app`]

Check the logs of a pod `amx-app` to verify if it uses *{intel-amx}*. In the *OpenShift Container Platform* web console, navigate to *Workloads > Pods*. Change project to `amx-app` and open the *Logs* tab in the pod details. The appearance of avx_512_core_amx_bf16 flag on the list of compiled instructions confirms that {intel-amx} is used.

As part of this pattern, HashiCorp Vault has been installed. Refer to the section on https://validatedpatterns.io/secrets/vault/[Vault].

== Next steps

After the management hub is set up and works correctly, attach one or more managed clusters to the architecture.

For instructions on deploying the edge, refer to link:../mcg-amx-managed-cluster/[Attach a managed cluster (edge) to the management hub].

//For instructions on deploying the edge, refer to xref:/multicloud-gitops/mcg-managed-cluster.adoc#attach-managed-cluster[Attach a managed cluster (edge) to the management hub].
